# ClearDB

This is a project of a SQL Database in Golang, it is a side project of mine, imagining how to code a SQL database, it is in development and I do not know when can be used.

## How to run

Just run the main.go file.

## Commands

  * CREATE DATABASE dbName;
    * The command itself ins't case sensitive, you can run like this cReAtE DaTaBase, but the database name it is case sensitive.
    * This command will just craete the database.
  * LIST DBS;
    * This command it ins't case sensitive as well, you can use this LiST DbS
    * This command for now will just return a table with the database name and tables quantities.
